A Minimalistic To-Do List Android App

Tested and used a lot of paid and free To-Do list apps out there, but none really matched my workflow. So I decided to build mine that was minimalistic and had only the features I wanted.

On completion of a task, you swipe left or right to delete or 'Phrag' it.
